# IT-312
Dice Game Farkle Program

I created this program for my final project in my IT course, C++/.NET for game development.  The program is only
in C++, I did not use any of the .NET framework.  The course only taught us how to read and write files with
.NET so I just used the native C++ fstream library for that functionality.
