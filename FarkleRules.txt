*********************************Overview***********************************
Farkle is a dice rolling game of risk and luck.  Each player will take a turn,
in order, rolling dice and trying to score points.  Each turn will start with
six dice being rolled, and points are scored for every 1, 5, or any set of three
dice of the same value.  Any dice set aside by the player cannot be rolled again
unless all dice have scored.  The player may choose to keep the points after each
roll (with a special opening score scenario), or press his or her luck and roll 
again.  Any roll that does not produce points results in a farkle and the player
loses all points gained in the current turn and play moves to the next player.
There are special rules for opening each players scoring, and decision strategy 
involved which will be covered in the following topics.

********************************Scoring**************************************
Sets of three are the most valuable way to score in Farkle.  For values 2-6, a
set of three is worth 100 times the value of the dice.  Example: if you roll
three 5's, it is worth 500 points.  1's are special and are worth 1,000 points
for a set of three! Points can also be scored for individual 5's and 1's.  Each
5 rolled is worth 50 points and each 1 rolled is worth 100 points.

********************************After The Roll********************************
After each roll, if no points are produced by the roll than the player has farkled
and will score no points for the turn and play moves to the next player.  If the
roll has produced points, then the player has decisions to make.  The player must keep
at least one scoring die set aside after each roll, and these dice cannot be used on
subsequent rolls during the turn.  If the player has 0 points at the start of the turn, 
he or she must score 1,000 points in the current turn to "open" the scoring.  Once 
the player has opened, he or she can choose to keep the points accumulated after each 
roll (even if its only 50 points), or roll again.  If the player keeps the points, the 
turn is over and the player adds the points accumulated to his or her total and passes 
play along.  If the player rolls again, all scoring dice kept are set aside and the player
will roll the remainging dice.  If the player has kept all six dice then the player gets
all six dice back and must roll again.

***********************************Strategy************************************
Not all scoring dice need to be kept.  Sometimes, it is advantageous to keep only
some of the scoring dice and roll again to give the player more dice to roll.  
This increases the odds of getting sets of three or getting at least one 1 or 5 to 
avoid farkling.
************************************Winning*************************************
The game enters the "final round" when one player is over 10,000 points.  Once a player has
reached this threshold, all other players will get one more turn to try to beat
that players current score.  The player who breaks the 10,000 point threshold will NOT
get another roll.  After the final round is over, whoever has the most points is the winner!
